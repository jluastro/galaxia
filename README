firefox GalaxiaData/docs/index.html

The output data is in EBF file format.
Libraries for reading and writing data in EBF file format 
are available at http://ebfformat.sourceforge.net.  
Currently supported languages are
C, C++, Java, Fortran, Python, IDL and Matlab. 


The data for Bullock and Johnston models 
are not included in the standard distribution so as to 
reduce the size of the distribution. 
This can be downloaded from 
http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/~sanjib/code/bj.tar.gz

These can be easily plugged in by downloading them separately and 
then putting them in GalaxiaData/nbody1/ folder. 
cd GalaxiaData/nbody1
tar -zxvf bj.tar.gz
